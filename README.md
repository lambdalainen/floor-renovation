# floor-renovation

I had a small water damage in the kitchen. The maintenance company removed a small part
of the floor and dried it with machine for a week.

I decided to redo the floor myself. Below are some notes about the process. This is
my first time building a floor so mistakes were inevitably made. I'll highlight
the mistakes I made and some other important aspects during the process.
