# floor-renovation

I had a small water damage in the kitchen. The maintenance company removed a small part
of the floor and dried it with machine for a week.

I decided to redo the floor myself. Below are some notes about the process. This is
my first time building a floor so mistakes were inevitably made. I'll highlight
the mistakes I made and some other important aspects during the process.

## Isolate the work area

It was anticipated that dust will be generated during the process, so it was a good
idea to isolate the work area.

A pry bar might be useful here.

## Rip away the existing floor

The existing floor is made from soft plastic and is easy to rip away.

After that, the cork underlayment is exposed.
